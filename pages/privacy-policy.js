              <h2 className="pp-title">21. DISPUTE RESOLUTION </h2>

              <p className="urbanist-black-16">
                Informal Negotiations The Parties agree to first attempt to
                negotiate any Dispute (aside from those Disputes expressly
                provided below) informally for at least thirty (30) days before
                commencing arbitration in order to expedite resolution and
                manage the costs of any dispute, controversy, or claim relating
                to these terms and conditions (each, a "Dispute" and
                collectively, the "Disputes"). Following written notice from one
                party to the other, such informal conversations begin. Binding
                Arbitration Except for those disputes that are expressly
                excluded herein, disputes between the Parties that cannot be
                settled through informal dialogue will be finally and
                exclusively settled through binding arbitration. YOU UNDERSTAND
                THAT IN THE ABSENCE OF THIS PROVISION, YOU WOULD BE ENTITLED TO
                A JURY TRIAL AND THE RIGHT TO SUE IN COURTThe arbitration will
                begin and be conducted in accordance with the Commercial The
                American Arbitration Association's Commercial Arbitration Rules
                ("AAA") and, where applicable, its Supplementary Procedures for
                Consumer Related Disputes ("AAA Consumer Rules"), both of which
                are available at the AAA website www.adr.org, shall govern the
                commencement and conduct of the arbitration. The AAA Consumer
                Rules shall govern your arbitration fees and, when applicable,
                set a limit on your portion of the arbitrators' fees. We shall
                cover any arbitration costs and fees if the arbitrator finds
                that the charges are unreasonable. The arbitration might take
                place in person, online, over the phone, or with the submission
                of papers. If requested by either Party, the arbitrator need not
                include a statement of reasons in the written ruling they make.
                Every award may be contested if the arbitrator doesn't follow
                the relevant laws, which is required by the arbitration
                agreement. The arbitration will take place in Delaware, unless
                the applicable AAA rules or applicable legislation specify
                otherwise. Except as otherwise specified herein, the Parties may
                bring a lawsuit in court to compel arbitration, halt legal
                action while an arbitration is being held, or to uphold, alter,
                reverse, or declare final the arbitrator's decision. The parties
                hereby agree and waive any defenses of lack of personal
                jurisdiction and forum non-convenience with regard to venue and
                jurisdiction in such state and federal courts in the event that
                a dispute advances in court rather than through arbitration. The
                United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International
                Sale of Products and the Uniform Computer Information
                Transaction Act (UCITA) are not applicable to these Terms and
                Conditions. Any dispute involving the Site that is brought by
                any Party must never be brought more than one (1) year after the
                cause of action first materialized. A court of competent
                jurisdiction within the courts listed for jurisdiction above
                will resolve any disputes falling within this provision if it is
                determined that any part of it is unlawful or unenforceable, and
                the Parties agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of such
                court. If this provision is determined to be unlawful or
                unenforceable, neither Party will choose to arbitrate any
                disputes falling within that portion of this provision.
                Restrictions The Parties acknowledge that any arbitration will
                only cover the particular disputes between the Parties. To the
                fullest extent permitted by law, there is no right or authority
                for any dispute to be brought in a purported representative
                capacity on behalf of the general public or any other
                individuals, (a) no arbitration shall be joined with any other
                proceeding, (b) no right or authority for any dispute to be
                arbitrated on a class-action basis or to use class-action
                procedures. Exceptions to Informal Negotiations and Arbitration
                The Parties acknowledge and agree that the following Disputes
                are not subject to the foregoing provisions regarding informal
                negotiations and binding arbitration: (a) any Disputes
                pertaining to, or arising from, allegations of theft, piracy,
                invasion of privacy, or unauthorized use; (b) any Dispute
                pertaining to, or arising from, any claim for injunctive relief;
                and (c) any Dispute seeking to enforce or protect, or concerning
                the validity of, any of a Party. If this agreement is found to
                be invalid or unenforceable, neither Party will choose to
                arbitrate any disputes that fall under the invalid or
                unenforceable portion of this clause; instead, those disputes
                will be resolved by a court with appropriate jurisdiction within
                the jurisdictional jurisdictions listed above, and the Parties
                consent to the personal jurisdiction of that court.{" "}
